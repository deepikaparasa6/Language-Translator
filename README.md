#  Language Translator using Python & Gradio

A multilingual text translation web application built using Python, Gradio, and the Deep Translator library. This project leverages the Google Translate API to provide seamless language conversion across a wide range of global languages through a simple, user-friendly interface.

##  Project Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a lightweight and interactive language translation tool that demonstrates the practical application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in real-world scenarios.

---

##  Technologies Used

- **Python** – Core programming language
- **Gradio** – For building the interactive user interface
- **Deep Translator** – For integrating Google Translate functionality
- **Google Colab** – Platform used for development and testing

---

##  Key Features

- Translate text between over many languages
- Auto-detection of supported languages via dropdown
- Interactive and clean UI built using Gradio
- Robust error handling for invalid inputs
- Lightweight and easy to deploy

##  How It Works

1. User inputs a sentence to be translated.
2. Selects the source and target languages.
3. On clicking “Submit,” the app uses the `GoogleTranslator` class from the Deep Translator package to return the translated text.
4. The output is displayed instantly on the same interface.
