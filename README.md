## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a lightweight and interactive language translation tool that demonstrates the practical application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in real-world scenarios.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** – Core programming language
- **Gradio** – For building the interactive user interface
- **Deep Translator** – For integrating Google Translate functionality
- **Google Colab** – Platform used for development and testing

## ✨ Key Features

- Translate text between over many languages
- Auto-detection of supported languages via dropdown
- Interactive and clean UI built using Gradio
- Robust error handling for invalid inputs
- Lightweight and easy to deploy

## 🎯 How It Works

1. User inputs a sentence to be translated.
2. Selects the source and target languages.
3. On clicking “Submit,” the app uses the `GoogleTranslator` class from the Deep Translator package to return the translated text.
4. The output is displayed instantly on the same interface.
